## 📌 Project Motivation

This project originated from a clinical and research-driven question:

> **Why do some patients develop resistance to antihistamines over time?**

Antihistamines are widely prescribed to manage allergic conditions. However, prolonged or repeated usage may lead to reduced effectiveness in certain patients. In medical practice, physicians often shift between **first-generation** and **second-generation antihistamines** depending on patient response and observed resistance.

After reviewing multiple research papers and clinical discussions, it became evident that antihistamine resistance is not random. It is influenced by multiple factors, including:

- Patient medical history  
- Previous drug exposure  
- Type and severity of allergies  
- Co-existing medical conditions  
- Environmental and food-related allergy triggers  
- Individual immunological response  

This led to an important question:

> **Can machine learning help predict antihistamine resistance using patient-related features?**

This project is an exploratory attempt to answer that question using supervised learning techniques.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To develop a classification model capable of predicting whether a patient is likely to develop resistance to antihistamines based on clinical and demographic attributes.

---

## Machine Learning Models Implemented

The following classification models were implemented and compared:

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- XGBoost Classifier  
- Voting Classifier (Ensemble Model)  

This approach allows comparison between linear, tree-based, and ensemble learning methods.

---

## Evaluation Metrics

Model performance was evaluated using:

- Accuracy Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
- Classification Report  

Ensemble models such as **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** demonstrated strong predictive performance.
